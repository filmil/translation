What's Inside?
---------------

This is a translator's workplace for translating Skype into Serbian.

It is based on the Translation Toolkit and my scripts, skype2po and
po2skype that convert between Skype's language files ("lang") and GNU
gettext and back.

Please examine the Makefile in this directory to find out more about 
the automated translation process.

I use several tools, as follows:

o GNU Make for build automation
o Qt Translator, for the Skype translation generator for Linux
o python as the script interpreter
o skype2po and po2skype for the lang-to-PO-to-lang conversion
o the "vucko" utility to convert Cyrillic to Latin
o GNU Gettext and friends for translation maintenance

If you want to make your own translation system based on what you see
here, you may need only a fraction of all the tools.
